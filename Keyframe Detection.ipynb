In the most common types of segmentation, video is partitioned into shots, camera-takes, or scenes.\n","\n","**Key Frames:**\n","\n","Key frames are representative frames selected from a video sequence. They capture the essence of the video and are used as reference points for various tasks such as summarization, indexing, and segmentation. In video segmentation, key frames play a crucial role in summarizing the content of a video and facilitating efficient processing.\n","\n","Key frames can be selected based on different criteria such as temporal distance, content similarity, motion characteristics, or scene changes.\n","\n","**Advantages:** Using key frames reduces the computational complexity of video processing tasks by focusing on representative frames rather than analyzing every frame in the video sequence."],"metadata":{"id":"Xcmnh1siaa1f"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**OpenCV**  is a popular library for computer vision tasks, including image and video processing, object detection, and more.\n","\n","**NumPy** is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
